# InvestigatePotentialPrototypes.

Project to examine public pension plans in the CRR PPD and examine clustering of plans into different prototypes (to the extent they really do cluster in that fashion).

Purpose of this is to do the analysis needed to identify prototype clusters, and to identify "representatative" plans that are close to (typical of) their cluster average. 

Then, in the package pp.prototypes we'll use detailed data from selected representative plans to produce prototypes that can be used in the simulation model.
